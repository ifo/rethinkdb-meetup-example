# RethinkDB Tutorial

#### This is the RethinkDB tutorial project for the [Pittsburgh Try New Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/trynewtech/events/167173392/)

## Before you start:

### If you're at the meetup

1. Go to the URL specified by the instructor.
2. Add yourself to the project database using RethinkDB's web interface.
3. You should see your name (or whatever you enter) appear on the screen!
4. :)

### If you're not at the meetup

1. This will eventually be a set of instructions for how to setup an included seed database.

## After you start:

### Have fun! :)

P.S. Can you tell this is my first time using markdown?
